# eBook-to-audio-converter
The eBook to Audio Converter project using Python is designed to convert text-based eBooks into audio files. This is particularly useful for making books accessible to those who prefer listening to reading, such as people with visual impairments or those who enjoy audiobooks. The project involves several key components:

Project Overview
Text Extraction:

The project can handle eBook PDF formats
Libraries like PyPDF2 for PDF files used to extract text from the eBooks.
Text-to-Speech Conversion:

The extracted text is converted into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.
The pyttsx3 library is commonly used for offline TTS conversion, while the gTTS library (Google Text-to-Speech) can be used for higher quality and multilingual support, though it requires an internet connection.
here we use gTTs library
Audio Output:

The generated audio can be saved in common formats like MP3 or WAV, making it easy to listen to on various devices.
Users can customize the voice (gender, accent), speed, and volume of the output audio.
Technical Implementation
Libraries and Tools:

PyPDF2: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
pyttsx3: An offline text-to-speech conversion library with support for multiple voice properties.
gTTS: A Google Text-to-Speech library for generating high-quality speech (requires internet).
Process Workflow:
pygame: this library is used to play the extracted audio.
Input: Accept an eBook file from the user.
Processing:
Extract text from the eBook.
Optionally clean and format the text (remove unnecessary characters, handle line breaks, etc.).
Output:
Convert the text to speech.
Save the resulting audio file or play it directly.
Customization and Features:

Voice Options: Allow users to select different voices and accents.
Speed Control: Adjust the speaking rate to suit user preferences.
Error Handling: Ensure the system can handle different eBook structures and incomplete files gracefully.
UI/UX: If the project includes a user interface, it could be a simple command-line interface or a graphical interface using frameworks like Tkinter
